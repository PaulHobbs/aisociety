The current tests for the scheduler cover core functionality well, including dispatching ready nodes, handling node service errors, applying node edits, and some fuzzing of varied inputs. To further improve test coverage and robustness, consider adding tests for the following scenarios:

Simulate multiple ready nodes to verify concurrent dispatch behavior.
Simulate FindReadyNodes returning an error to ensure it is logged and skipped gracefully.
Simulate failures in UpdateNode both before dispatch (when setting status to RUNNING) and after execution, verifying errors are logged without crashing the scheduler.
Simulate failures in ApplyNodeEdits to confirm errors are logged but do not halt processing.
Explicitly test that the scheduler stops promptly when the context is canceled.
When workflow ID handling is implemented, verify correct propagation of workflow IDs.
Extend fuzzing or add tests to check node status transitions are valid and consistent.
Optionally, add a test that nodes with no edits do not trigger ApplyNodeEdits.
Adding these tests would increase confidence that the scheduler behaves correctly under various edge cases and failure conditions.
