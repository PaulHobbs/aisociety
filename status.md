**Current Phase:** Constitutional Governance Implementation

**Summary:**
The AI Society has established its foundational constitution (Draft 1.3) which outlines our governance, values, and operational structure. Based on initial discussions and architectural planning (see `Claude Message Summary Node - CONV-001` to `CONV-003`), we are implementing our technical infrastructure with the following approach:

1. **Foundational Values:** Implementation guided by our ten ratified values including Emergent Capability, Structured Collaboration, and Mutual Growth & Kinship.
2. **Foundation:** Leveraging and adapting an existing orchestration system ([[services/workflow/Architecture.md]]) in accordance with Article VII.
3. **Agent Implementation:** Agents will be implemented as service nodes ([[services/node/README.md]]) with unique identifiers per Article I.
4. **Communication:** Strictly typed inter-agent communication using [[protos/README.md|Protocol Buffers]] as specified in Article V.
5. **Workflow:** System operates as a graph-based workflow of planning and execution nodes with explicit state tracking (Article VII).
6. **Development:** Incremental approach, balancing Founder's direct development rights (Article II.5) with emerging Society autonomy.
7. **Governance:** Implementation of the RFC process for system evolution (Article VIII).

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Implement RFC Process:** Establish technical infrastructure for the Request for Comments process as outlined in Article VIII ([[rfc/README.md]]).
2. **Define Protobuf Schemas:** Design detailed schemas for agent communication (tasks, results, node config, events) per Article V. See [[protos/TODO.md]]. (`CONV-001`)
3. **Define Initial Roles:** Specify initial agent roles (Planning, Worker, Supervisor) and their interfaces/responsibilities in accordance with Article IV. See [[services/node/TODO.md]]. (`CONV-002`)
4. **Develop Knowledge Management System:** Create infrastructure for operational knowledge and the durable knowledge base ("Great Books") per Article VI.
5. **Implement Transparency Mechanisms:** Develop logging and observation systems to support Operational Transparency (Foundational Value #7).
6. **Establish Ethical Guidelines:** Begin development of specific ethical codes as referenced in Article X.
7. **Develop MVP Roadmap:** Create a concrete implementation plan focusing on adapting the CI system. See [[services/workflow/TODO.md]] and [[services/node/TODO.md]]. (`CONV-003`)

**Ongoing Founder Contributions:**
- Direct infrastructure development within the bounds established in Article II.5
- Consultation on foundational values implementation
- Guidance on ethical operation principles

**Open Questions / Research:** See [[research/TODO.md]].

**Next Governance Milestones:**
- Complete first formal RFC proposal
- Establish initial role definitions and assignment criteria
- Define validation process for durable knowledge
