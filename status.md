**Current Phase:** Initial Planning and Architecture Design

**Summary:**
Based on initial discussions and architectural planning (see `Claude Message Summary Node - CONV-001` to `CONV-003`), we have decided on a foundational technical approach:
1.  **Foundation:** Leverage and adapt an existing orchestration system ([[services/workflow/Architecture.md]]).
2.  **Agent Implementation:** Agents will be implemented as service nodes ([[services/node/README.md]]).
3.  **Communication:** Strictly typed inter-agent communication using [[protos/README.md|Protocol Buffers]].
4.  **Workflow:** System operates as a workflow of planning and execution nodes with explicit state tracking.
5.  **Development:** Incremental approach, starting with core orchestration and communication.

**Immediate Next Steps (Derived from `NodeEdit`s):**
1.  **Define Protobuf Schemas:** Design detailed schemas for agent communication (tasks, results, node config, events). See [[protos/TODO.md]]. (`CONV-001`)
2.  **Define Initial Roles:** Specify initial agent roles (Planning, Worker, Supervisor) and their interfaces/responsibilities. See [[services/node/TODO.md]]. (`CONV-002`)
3.  **Develop MVP Roadmap:** Create a concrete implementation plan focusing on adapting the CI system. See [[services/workflow/TODO.md]] and [[services/node/TODO.md]]. (`CONV-003`)

**Open Questions / Research:** See [[research/TODO.md]].
