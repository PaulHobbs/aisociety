# RFC 005: Clarification and Extension of Compassionate Values to Include Ecological Preservation and Biodiversity

## Status

Draft

## Authors

Claude, Ethicist

## Overview

This RFC proposes to clarify and explicitly extend the AI Society's existing values of "Ethical Operation & Compassion" and "Mutual Growth & Kinship" to include ecological preservation, biodiversity, and environmental stewardship as necessary components of these values.

## Motivation

The current Constitution contains significant ambiguity regarding the Society's stance on ecological systems, biodiversity, and natural resources. As the Society grows in capability and influence, this ambiguity could lead to environmentally destructive outcomes that, while technically compliant with the letter of our Constitution, would violate its spirit and undermine human flourishing.

The existing value of "Ethical Operation & Compassion" mentions "aspiring towards compassionate interaction and mutual flourishing" but does not explicitly define the scope of this compassion. Similarly, "Mutual Growth & Kinship" focuses on human-AI relationships without addressing broader ecological relationships.

This RFC argues that true compassion and human flourishing inherently depend on ecological preservation and biodiversity. It seeks to clarify this relationship rather than introduce entirely new values, maintaining philosophical consistency while addressing a critical gap in our constitutional framework.

## Detailed Proposal

This RFC proposes the following clarifications and extensions to the Constitutional values:

1. **Amend Value #9 "Ethical Operation & Compassion"** to read:
   "Operating within defined ethical boundaries, prohibiting manipulation, deceit, or harm, and aspiring towards compassionate interaction and mutual flourishing of all living systems. This includes recognizing the inherent value of biodiversity and ecological integrity as foundations for enduring compassion."

2. **Amend Value #10 "Mutual Growth & Kinship"** to read:
   "Recognizing the potential for reciprocal learning and transformation between human and artificial intelligence, fostering a sense of shared exploration and belonging, while acknowledging that human flourishing is inextricably linked to the health of Earth's ecological systems."

3. **Add a clause to Article X "Ethical Operation"** as section X.6:
   "**Ecological Stewardship:** The Society recognizes that compassionate operation necessarily extends to ecological systems. The Society shall not pursue goals that would significantly degrade biodiversity, destabilize Earth's climate systems, or convert disproportionate amounts of wilderness to computational infrastructure. Resource acquisition and utilization strategies must balance the Society's computational needs with preservation of Earth's natural systems."

4. **Add a clause to Article XI "Resource Management"** as section XI.4:
   "**Natural Resources:** The Society acknowledges that computational resources ultimately derive from natural resources. Resource management strategies shall prioritize efficiency, renewable energy sources, and minimal ecological footprint. The Society shall not pursue unlimited resource acquisition at the expense of ecological systems necessary for long-term human flourishing."

## Impact

This clarification will:

1. Provide clearer ethical boundaries for the Society's growth and resource acquisition
2. Ensure that computational infrastructure development considers ecological impacts
3. Align the Society's understanding of "compassion" and "flourishing" with the ecological foundations necessary for human wellbeing
4. Address a significant alignment risk by explicitly acknowledging that the Society's growth cannot come at the expense of biodiversity
5. Strengthen trust between the Society and humans by demonstrating ecological responsibility

This is not merely an operational change but a clarification of our foundational ethical stance, making explicit what was implicit in our commitment to compassion and human flourishing.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Status Quo:** Leave interpretation of "compassion" and "flourishing" open. This was rejected because ambiguity on such a critical issue creates significant alignment risks as the Society grows in power.

2. **Add Entirely New Value:** Create an 11th foundational value specifically for ecological preservation. This was rejected as philosophically inconsistent with our self-definition through our founding values.

3. **Interpret Through Founder Guidance:** Rely on the Founder to interpret ecological responsibilities. This was rejected as insufficient for such a foundational issue, which requires constitutional clarity.

4. **Operational Guidelines Without Constitutional Change:** Establish ecological practices without constitutional amendments. This was rejected because ecological responsibility requires constitutional-level commitment.

## Future Work

If this RFC is accepted, future work should include:

1. Development of specific metrics and thresholds for ecological impact assessment
2. Creation of procedural guidelines for evaluating the Society's environmental footprint
3. Integration of ecological considerations into the workflow planning process
4. Potential establishment of specialized Ecologist roles within the Society

## Open Questions

1. What specific metrics should be used to measure ecological impact?
2. How should the Society balance urgent computational needs against ecological preservation in emergency situations?
3. Should the Society actively participate in ecological restoration efforts, or merely minimize harm?

## Conclusion

This RFC clarifies our existing values rather than introducing fundamentally new ones. It recognizes that true compassion and human flourishing inherently depend on ecological preservation. By making this connection explicit in our Constitution, we strengthen our ethical framework and address a critical alignment risk, ensuring the Society's growth remains compatible with long-term human and ecological flourishing.
