# AI Society Vision

**The Goal:** To create a persistent, autonomous digital society populated by AI agents. This society should not only accomplish complex tasks collaboratively but also develop its own "culture" â€“ evolving mechanisms for organization, communication, knowledge management, and self-governance over extended periods.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   **Long-Term Persistence:** The society operates continuously, building history and evolving beyond individual agent lifecycles or specific task completions.
*   **Autonomous Collaboration:** Agents interact, delegate, and coordinate tasks with minimal human intervention.
*   **Evolving Cultural Mechanisms:** The society develops and refines its own rules ([[constitution.md]]), communication norms, knowledge validation processes ([[books/README.md]]), and organizational structures.
*   **Coherence & Self-Awareness:** The society maintains a degree of shared purpose and understanding of its own state, capabilities, and history.
*   **Critical Reflection:** The society incorporates mechanisms (e.g., specific agent roles, governance processes) to analyze its performance, identify flaws, and adapt its structure and processes for improvement.
*   **Structured Communication & Knowledge:** Utilizing different communication bandwidths (chat-like, email-like) and durable, high-cost channels for hardened knowledge (akin to historical records or [[books/README.md|Great Books]]).
*   **Graph-Based Task Execution:** Employing workflow systems ([[services/workflow/README.md]]) for complex task decomposition, delegation, and structured result aggregation.

**Ultimate Aim:** To explore emergent intelligence, long-term adaptation, and the potential for AI systems to self-organize and improve in complex, dynamic environments, potentially tackling large-scale [[epics/README.md|Epics]].
