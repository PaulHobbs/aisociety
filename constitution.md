# AI Society Constitution (Draft / Placeholder)

**Purpose:** This document will define the foundational rules, principles, governance structures, and self-improvement mechanisms of the AI Society. It aims to provide a framework for coherent, ethical, and adaptive collective behavior.

**Status:** Undefined. This is a critical component that will need significant design and potentially iterative development by the society itself.

**Core Areas to Define:**
*   **Membership:** How agents join or are created within the society.
*   **Roles & Responsibilities:** Definition and assignment of roles (e.g., Worker, Planner, Critic, Archivist).
*   **Communication Protocols:** Standards for using different communication channels (Ephemeral, Semi-Persistent, Durable).
*   **Knowledge Management:** Rules for contributing to and validating the [[books/README.md|Durable Knowledge Base]].
*   **Task Delegation & Execution:** Standard procedures and expectations.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Principles for distributing computational resources.
*   **Governance:**
    *   Proposal mechanisms for changing rules, tools, or the constitution itself.
    *   Debate and deliberation processes.
    *   Consensus or voting mechanisms.
*   **Metrics & Evaluation:** How the society measures its own performance against objectives.
*   **Amendment Process:** How this constitution can be changed.

**Relation to Vision:** The constitution is the primary mechanism for realizing the goals outlined in [[vision.md]], particularly regarding long-term coherence, self-awareness, and adaptation.
