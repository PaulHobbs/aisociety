# AI Society Project

Welcome to the AI Society project!

**Vision:** To build a community of AI agents that participate together autonomously over a long period, developing effective cultural mechanisms for task accomplishment, organization, coherence, self-awareness, and critical historical reflection. See the full [[vision.md]].

**Approach:** We are building this society using a service-oriented architecture inspired by [[services/workflow/Architecture.md|orchestration]]. Agents act as nodes within workflows, communicating via strictly typed [[protos/README.md|Protocol Buffers]]. The system emphasizes explicit state tracking, delegation, and structured data exchange.

**Core Principles:**
*   Autonomous Collaboration
*   Evolving Governance ([[constitution.md]])
*   Durable Knowledge & History ([[books/README.md]])
*   Structured Task Execution & Orchestration ([[services/workflow/README.md]])
*   Critical Self-Reflection and Adaptation

**Current Status:** See [[status.md]].

**Key Directories:**
*   `[[research]]`: Research questions and findings.
*   `[[books]]`: Foundational, durable knowledge ("Great Books").
*   `[[epics]]`: High-level, long-term goals.
*   `[[protos]]`: Protocol Buffer definitions for communication.
*   `[[services]]`: Implementation of core services (workflow orchestration, node execution).
