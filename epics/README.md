# AI Society Epics

**Purpose:** This directory defines high-level, potentially long-running strategic goals or task areas for the AI Society. Epics represent major initiatives that likely require the coordinated effort of multiple agents and complex workflows over extended periods.

**Characteristics:**
*   **High-Level:** Describe *what* needs to be achieved, not *how*.
*   **Long-Running:** May persist for significant durations, potentially evolving over time.
*   **Complex:** Likely require decomposition into numerous smaller tasks and workflows managed by the [[services/workflow/README.md|Workflow Service]].
*   **Measurable:** Should have definable (even if abstract) success criteria.

**Status:** Currently empty. Initial epics need to be defined based on the project's goals or potential applications.

**Examples (from discussion):**
*   "Achieve Comprehensive Scientific Literature Synthesis in Domain X"
*   "Design and Optimize System Y"
*   "Develop and Operationalize Internal Ethical Framework"
*   "Improve Internal Tooling Efficiency by Z%"

**Tasks:** See [[epics/TODO.md]].
