# Books TODO

*   [ ] Define the process (governance mechanism) for promoting information to "Book" status. What is the "cost structure" or consensus requirement?
*   [ ] Design the storage and versioning mechanism for these books.
*   [ ] Identify initial candidate documents once the society is operational (e.g., the first ratified [[constitution.md]]).
*   [ ] Specify how agents access or reference content from these books. Is it via specific retrieval agents, or cached context?
