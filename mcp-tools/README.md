# MCP Tools for AI Society (Cold Start Phase)

This directory contains a suite of **Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers** designed to accelerate the **initial development** of the AI Society system. These tools assist human developers in bootstrapping the knowledge base, designing communication protocols, architecting workflows, and aggregating research.

## Included MCP Servers

- **Knowledge Base Curator:** Organize, review, and promote foundational knowledge and design documents.
- **Protobuf & API Design Assistant:** Rapidly design, validate, and generate code for communication schemas.
- **Workflow & Architecture Designer:** Visualize, simulate, and refine workflow DAGs and service interactions.
- **Research Aggregator:** Collect, summarize, and track relevant research papers and best practices.

## Purpose

These MCP servers provide **human-in-the-loop** tools to:

- Build a durable, well-organized knowledge base
- Accelerate API and schema design
- Clarify and iterate on system architecture
- Stay informed on relevant research

## Status

Planning phase. See individual subdirectories and `TODO.md` for implementation details.
