# AI Society Research

This directory tracks research questions, experiments, potential approaches, and relevant background work for building the AI Society.

**Purpose:** To explore the frontiers necessary for realizing the [[vision.md]], particularly aspects related to emergent behavior, long-term adaptation, governance, and cultural evolution in AI systems.

**Areas of Focus:**
*   Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) coordination strategies.
*   Computational social science models.
*   Reputation and trust systems for AI agents.
*   Automated governance and consensus mechanisms.
*   Knowledge representation and synthesis for collective intelligence.
*   Measuring emergent properties like "coherence" or "cultural effectiveness".
*   Techniques for safe and robust AI self-modification / evolution.

**Current Tasks:** See [[research/TODO.md]].
