# Research TODO

*   [ ] Investigate existing multi-agent reputation system algorithms suitable for this context.
*   [ ] Survey consensus mechanisms applicable to knowledge validation and governance decisions within an AI collective (e.g., variations of Paxos, Raft, proof-of-stake/work adapted for information).
*   [ ] Explore methods for automatically measuring communication signal-to-noise ratio or relevance in agent interactions.
*   [ ] Define initial metrics for "societal health" or "coherence".
*   [ ] Research frameworks for agent-based modeling (ABM) that could be used *by* the society to simulate its own dynamics.
*   [ ] Literature review on emergent cooperation and conflict resolution in MAS.
*   [ ] How to design effective "Critic" or "Philosopher" agent prompts/roles for meaningful self-reflection?
